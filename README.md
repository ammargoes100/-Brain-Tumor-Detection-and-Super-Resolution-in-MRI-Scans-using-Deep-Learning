# -Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Super-Resolution-in-MRI-Scans-using-Deep-Learning
**Final year project flutter android**

**ABSTRACT:**
Tumor Tool is a medical image processing android app which helps doctors and patients to diagnose
Magnetic resonance images (MRI) by detecting brain tumor and enhancing their resolution using deep
learning and artificial intelligence. 

**OBJECTIVE:**
Projectâ€™s main objectives are to help medical experts and patients to not only detect brain tumor in MRI
scans but also gain information on the disease, Project also ensures that in case of low resolution MRI scans
which are hard to diagnose with the use of image processing convert it into an improved higher resolution
MRI scans

**TOOLS:**
Tools used in project:
1) Android Studio
2) Flutter
3) Computer Vision
4) Python Cloud Notebooks (Google Colab, Kaggle notebook)


**LIMITATIONS:**
Since the project uses deep learning models for brain tumor detection, and due to limited accuracy results
and prediction may produce incorrect results or failures due to models complexities. For enhancement of
resolution results may take longer than usual depending on size of image.

**FEATURES:**
1)Input MRI
2)Detect Brain Tumor
3)Enhance MRI Scan
4)View detailed Results
5)Download Results
6)View Previous Scans
